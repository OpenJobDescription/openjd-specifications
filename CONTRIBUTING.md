# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Issues

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report any issues that you encounter with
the documentation provided in this repository. When filing an issue, please check existing open,
or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue.

## Request for Comments

Open Job Description is under active development. We have released it because we'd like your feedback and 
participation as we move forward, together, in defining and implementing a specification that solves the problems in 
this space.

We have provided a RFC ("Request for Comment") process for proposing changes to the specification. 
RFCs can be created by anyone in the community, and is the process that the Open Job Description team
uses to propose changes. If you have an idea, a kernel of an idea, a problem to solve, or want to
provide your point of view on proposals then we encourage you to engage in this process.

See the [RFC Process] guide for information on this process.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *mainline* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, then
   it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
4. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
5. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
