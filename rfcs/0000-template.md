## Summary

A one paragraph summary of the proposed feature.

## Basic Examples

If the proposal involves a new or changed schema or syntax, then include some basic examples
that demonstrate how an end-user would use it.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? Focus on what sorts of workflows your
feature would enable for users. How common are those use cases: Are they specific to one
company's way of working, or more generally adopted?

If this is inspired by the capabilities of existing systems, then think about *why* the feature
is available in terms of what users accomplish with it. Our vision for Open Job Description is a
general and expressive specification rather than one that is a simply superset of features/syntax
available in existing distributed batch computing systems and pipeline tools.

## Specification

What are the specific changes that are being proposed?

Please write this in a form similar to the official formal specification documents as though
it could just be dropped in to the existing documentation as-is.

We suggest keeping our [design tenets] in mind while writing this part.

## Prior Art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to the proposal. Does a feature
like this exist in other systems? How is it expressed in those system(s)?

## Rejected Ideas

Why certain ideas that were brought while discussing this RFC were not ultimately pursued.
