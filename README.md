## Getting Started

The fastest way to understand the bones of Open Job Description is to understand both [How Jobs Are Constructed](https://github.com/xxyggoqtpcmcofkc/openjd-specifications/wiki/How-Jobs-Are-Constructed)
and [How Jobs Are Run](https://github.com/xxyggoqtpcmcofkc/openjd-specifications/wiki/How-Jobs-Are-Run).

## What is Open Job Description?

Open Job Description is a flexible open specification for defining render 
jobs which are portable between studios and render solutions. 

We created Open Job Description after hearing frequently from studios that they 
found the choice of render farm management tools to be daunting due to the 
effort required to update or replace their tooling around the render farm. We 
also heard from software developers that they were unable to realistically 
release render farm plugins for their own applications despite being the most 
qualified to do so, as the render farm landscape was fractured and releasing 
multiple plugins for different render farm solutions would quickly siphon all 
their development capacity away from improving their software. A standard way of 
defining render jobs, or really any type of work suited for completion on a 
render farm, makes tools and plugins portable and increases interoperability. 

For deeper insight into our thought process and goals, we recommend [this Academy Software Foundation talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AM3L6P-cAw&list=PL9dZxafYCWmxDFGc2CEq4SgCkZWKYW1m5&index=14)
