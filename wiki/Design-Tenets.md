# Design Tenets for Open Job Description

We have created a set of [tenets] to help guide the design of the Open Job Description specification. Unless
you know better ones, they are:

1. **Portable** - We strive for Open Job Description to be highly portable. Users should be able to use it where
   they want to use it, and author jobs that are portable to many different systems. Users should be able to use
   it with the technology stack of their choice.
2. **Expressive** - We strive to design features that are general in nature rather than narrowly tailored to specific
   use cases. We aim for our features to be usable for workflows and use-cases beyond our wildest imagination.
3. **Human readable and writable** - The artifacts that users create to interact with Open Job Description are easily
   understood and authored by a human with nothing more than a text editor. They lead to behavior that is easy to understand
   from a plain reading of the artifact, and can be reproduced in any compatible compute environment.
4. **Tooling parseable** - Artifacts for Open Job Description should be parseable by automated tooling to encourage
   a rich ecosystem of integrations from pipeline tooling to graphical interfaces and beyond.
