# Open Job Description Documentation

Open Job Description is a new flexible open-source specification developed by the team behind AWS Thinkbox
Deadline – the production proven, flexible compute management software for render farms – for defining render
jobs so they are portable between studios and between render solutions. Making render jobs portable across
multiple pipelines lets technical pipeline devs more easily and flexibly test, adapt and deploy the best
render solutions for their projects, eliminating the need for studios and developers to recreate every render
submission variant from scratch.

(( 2nd para: Trying to convey that: 1/ We know that the spec is not all-inclusive, complete, and fully capable of
dropping in to any workflow; and 2/ We're actively developing it, and open sourcing it to invite you along
on the journey with us to guide and steer the specification's evolution. ))
