# Open Job Description Sample Templates

This directory contains a set of sample templates for the Open Job Description standard.
The aim with these is to provide a small sampling of just some of the things that you
can do with Open Job Description, and a reference set of demonstrations of template
concepts that you can incorporate in to your own templates.

All samples are provided AS-IS. We strongly recommend that you test all samples thoroughly
before use, and customize the samples as required by your individual needs.

## Contributing

We encourage and welcome your contributions to this repository. Simply open a pull
request on this repository that includes your sample and a modification to this README
to add your sample to the index. We ask that all contributions be in YAML document format,
and follow the [sample template](./sample-template.yaml).

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for additional information.
